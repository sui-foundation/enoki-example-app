## Enoki Dev Portal Setup
### Setting up Enoki API keys
In order to use Enoki, you need to sign into the Enoki Dev Portal and set up your new project. Below are the steps required for this. 

1. Navigate to the [Enoki Dev Portal](https://portal.enoki.mystenlabs.com) and sign in with the email you want to manage your project with. 

    Note, that during your first time signing in, you'll be asked to provide some info to help Mysten Labs keep informed about who is using Enoki. 

    The portal should look something like this when you successfully log on: 
    ![Empty Portal](images/empty-dev-portal.png)

2. Click `+ Create your first App` and enter the name of your app. 

    You should see your project's page on the portal now:
    ![Empty Project](images/empty-project.png)

3. Click `+ Create new` under `New API Key`. 

    You will be given a prompt that looks like this: 
    ![New API Key Prompt](images/api-key-prompt.png)

    You'll need to select the following: 

    - API key type: 
      - [ ] Public: Select this type if you plan on using this key in a client-side app
      - [ ] Private: Select this type if you plan on using this key in a private backend server

    - Enabled networks: The Sui networks that this api key will work on
      - [ ] Devnet
      - [ ] Testnet
      - [ ] Mainnet - Note this will only work for published apps

    - Enabled features: The features that this api key will support
      - [ ] zkLogin
      - [ ] Sponsored transactions

    When creating a key for this demo app, select: 
    - [x] Public
    - [x] Testnet
    - [x] zkLogin
    - [x] Sponsored transactions

    Your api key should look something like this: 
    ![New API Key](images/new-api-key.png)

4. Now you have your Enoki API key! 
    
    To use the key in this demo, make a copy of [.env.template](./.env.template) named `.env.local` and paste in the key into `ENOKI_PUB_KEY`. It should look something like this: 

    ```
    ENOKI_PUB_KEY=enoki_public_1646656193035707ff4ef3aecafb455e
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
    ```

### Setting up your Enoki Auth Provider
To use the *zkLogin* feature, you will need to connect your auth provider to the Enoki Dev Portal. 

1. Navigate to the `Auth Providers` section of your Enoki project. 

    The Auth Providers section is where you can add and manage your app's auth providers. Currently, Enoki supports: 

    - Google
    - Twitch
    - Facebook
    - Apple

    It should look like this: 
    ![Empty Auth Provider Section](images/empty-auth-provider-page.png)

2. Click `+ New Auth Provider`

    You will be given a prompt that looks like this: 
    ![New Auth Provider Prompt](images/auth-provider-prompt.png)

    You'll need to select/input the following: 

    - Auth provider: 
      - [ ] Google
      - [ ] Facebook
      - [ ] Twitch
      - [ ] Apple

    - Client ID: The client given by your desired auth provider

    When creating a key for this demo app, select `Google` and paste your google client id. Follow the [instructions](#getting-your-google-client-id) to get your client id from Google.

    Your auth provider should look something like this: 
    ![New Auth Provider](images/new-auth-provider.png)

3. Now you have your Enoki Auth Provider! 

    To use the auth provider in this demo, make a copy of [.env.template](./.env.template) named `.env.local` and paste in the client id into `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`. It should look something like this: 

    ```
    ENOKI_PUB_KEY=enoki_public_1646656193035707ff4ef3aecafb455e
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1234567890
    ```

    You can also add more auth providers by repeating the steps above. 

    Your `.env.local` file should look something like this: 
    ```
    ENOKI_PUB_KEY=enoki_public_1646656193035707ff4ef3aecafb455e
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1234567890
    ```

    Note that you can add more auth providers by repeating the steps above.

4. You have successfully connected your auth provider to Enoki! 

    Reference this demo code as an example of implementing the Enoki auth flow in your app.

### Setting up Enoki Sponsor Transactions
In the Enoki Dev Portal, you can set up *Sponsored Transactions* by adding addresses and move targets that are supported. 

1. Navigate to the `Sponsored Transactions` section of your Enoki project. 

    The Sponsored Transactions section is where you can add and manage the addresses and move targets that you want to be supported in sponsored transactions. 

    It should look like this: 
    ![Empty Sponsored Transaction Section](images/empty-sponsored-transaction-page.png)

2. Add the addresses and move call targets you want to be supported. 

    Any allowed addresses are senders that can use sponsored transactions. Any allowed move call targets are functions operations that any of your users can use sponsored transactions for. 

    In this demo, the target, `0x5794fff859ee70e28ec8a419f2a73830fb66bcaaaf76a68e41fcaf5e057d7bcc::global_counter::increment` is supported. This means that any users signed into the demo app can call this target and the transaction will be sponsored (meaning the user won't have to pay the gas for this transaction).

    Your allow list should look something like this: 
    ![New Sponsored Transaction allow list](images/new-sponsored-transaction.png)

3. You have successfully set up your Enoki Sponsored Transaction allow list! 

    Reference this demo code as an example to implementing sponsored transactions in your app.


## Getting your Google Client ID
You will need to set up a Google Auth API key to use the Google Sign-In feature in this demo app.

1. Navigate to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Click `+ Create Credentials` and select `OAuth client ID`.

    ![Create OAuth client ID](images/create-credential.png)

3. Select `Web application` as the application type.
4. Add http://localhost:3000/ to the Authorized redirect URIs. For this project, also add http://localhost:3000/auth, otherwise Google will return a 400 error: redirect_uri_mismatch.

    Your setup should look something like this:
    ![OAuth setup](images/authorized-url.png)
5. Click `Create` and copy the client id.

    Your OAuth client info should look something like this:
    ![OAuth created](images/OAuth-created.png)

6. You can now paste this client id into the `.env.local` file as described in the [Setting up your Enoki Auth Provider](#setting-up-your-enoki-auth-provider) section.
